<ul style="font-size:24px" type="desc">
		<li>The <b>Hurwicz criterion</b> is one of the most widely used rules in decision-making under uncertainty.</li><br/>
		<li>It is realistic approach to take into account the degree or index of optimism or pessimism of the decision-maker in the process of decision-making. </li><br/>
		<li>If a, a constant lying between 0 and 1, denotes the degree of optimism, then degree of pessimism will be 1 - a. </li><br/>
		<li>Then a weighted average of maximum and minimum payoffs of an action, with a and 1 - a as weights, is computed. </li><br/>
		<li>The action with highest average is regarded as optimal.</li><br/>
		<li>"a" nearer to 1 indicates that decision-maker is optimistic while "a" value nearer to zero indicates that he is pessimistic.</li><br/>
		<li>If a = 0.5, the decision maker is said to be neutralist.</li><br/>
		<li>We built a calculator to calculate Hurwicz criterion for three actions such as A1,A2 & A3.</li>
		

		</ul>
		<h2 style="color:red">Instructions to use our calculator:</h2>
		
		<ol style="font-size:20px">
		  <li>User must enter the degree of optimism(a) and it should lie between 0 and 1</li>
		  <li>User must click "Calculate (1-a)" buttom to calculate the value of degree of pessimism</li>
		  <li>Then User must Enter the values of Maximum and Minimum Payoff for Actions A1, A2 AND A3 respectively.</li>
		  <li>Finally User must click the green color "Calculate" button to caluculate the "Weighted Average" and obtain the final result.</li>
