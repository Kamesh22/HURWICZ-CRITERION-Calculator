The Hurwicz criterion is arguably one of the most widely used 
rules in decision-making under uncertainty. It allows the 
decision maker to simultaneously take into account the best 
and the worst possible outcomes, by articulating a "coefficient 
of optimism" that determines the emphasis on the best end.

OBJECTIVES:
❑ To find whether the decision maker is an optimist, pessimist or 
neutralist by knowing if ‘a’ is nearer to 1 indicates that decision
maker is optimistic while a value nearer to zero indicates that he 
is pessimistic.
❑ To make the best decision under uncertainty by simultaneously
taking into accounts that the best and worst ends.
